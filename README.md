# ATS_tracking_llm_project
End to end Smart ATS Resume Analyzer. This tool uses Google Gemini API, which provides an interface to leverage Googleâ€™s **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for various text-based tasks. It analyzes resumes against job descriptions to:

1. **Match Percentage:** Shows how well your resume fits the job description.
2. **Missing Keywords:** Highlights any missing key terms.
3. **Profile Summary:** Offers a summary based on your resume.

The app is built using Streamlit, which is an open-source framework used to quickly build and deploy interactive web applications for data science and machine learning projects.
